# Welcome!
Of all the places on the internet, you seemed to have made your way to either the Github user [site](https://iansgithubacc.github.io/) of `IansGithubAcc` or its [repo](https://github.com/IansGithubAcc/IansGithubAcc.github.io).

The aim of this project is to give a quick overview of the projects I work on in my free time. Additionally, in the future I may write some blog posts, if I stumble upon anything interesting to share.

```{note}
This site is one of my latest projects at time of writing and it's still a work in progress. 
Much content is still missing for now. 
```

# Project overview 
## [This package](Projects/thispackage.md)
This webpage is one of my latests side projects. The aim is to give a concise and interactive overview of the hobby projects I'm working on.

## [Godot game](Projects/godotgame.md)
I've recently been dabbling a little in game development as a creative outlet. Currently, I'm working on a mobile game made in the Godot game engine.

## [Dash-hub](Projects/dash-hub.md)
`dash-hub` is a package I made after seeing some missing functionality in the opensource community surrounding [Plotly's Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/). The package allows you to host and mange multiple applications on a single server and adds functionality for backend integration.

## [Birdies](Projects/birdies.md)
Birdies is a fun little hobby project I picked up to help me identify birds. I use the e-bird API and image fetching to display birds that have been recently spotted around you. Furthermore, it includes functionality for spot return period heatmaps to help you find the best place to spot a specific bird yourself.
