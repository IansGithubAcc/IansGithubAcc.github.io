# Godot Game

```{hint}
Even though the game is still in pre-alpha, itâ€™s available and playable [here](https://ianmullens.itch.io/rpg)!

## Introduction

As a little creative outlet, I decided to explore game development. For a brief moment, I considered using `pygame` since `python` the programming language I've got the most experience in. But at the time it lacked traction for serious game projects (though I believe that's changed since). Since both Unreal Engine and Unity are closed-source, I chose to use Godot â€” an open-source engine with a growing community and solid capabilities.

## Concept

This project is primarily just for fun, but I do want it to be accessible to anyone curious enough to try it. Since most people have smart phones these days, I decided this would be my platform of choice.

Since I'm only a single hobby game developer, I decided my game needs to have some unique elements to set itself apart from the pro's. Coming up with a completely unique and well working concept is a difficult feat. This is why, instead, I combine multiple existing proven formulas into a (hopefully) unique mixture:
- Top-down, Zelda-style action RPG
- Local multiplayer support (sharing 1 screen)
- Drag-based controls for quick dodging and movement
- Reusable tile-based level design combined with real time random world generation
