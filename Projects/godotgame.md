# Godot Game

```{note}
Even though the game is still in pre-alpha, it’s available and playable [here](https://ianmullens.itch.io/rpg)!

## 🎮 Introduction

As a little side project, I decided to explore game development. For a brief moment, I considered using `pygame`, but at the time it lacked traction for serious game projects (though I believe that's changed since). Since both Unreal Engine and Unity are closed-source, I chose to use Godot — an open-source engine with a growing community and solid capabilities.

## 💡 Concept

This project is a creative outlet and built primarily for fun, but I want it to be accessible to anyone curious to try it. That’s why I’ve focused on optimizing the game for mobile and tablet devices.

The core design elements I’m experimenting with include:
- A top-down, Zelda-style action RPG
- Local multiplayer support
- Drag-based controls for quick dodging and movement
- Reusable tile-based level design for efficient world-building
