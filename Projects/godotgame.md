# Godot Game
```{note}
Even though the game is still in pre-alpha it is available and playable [here](https://ianmullens.itch.io/rpg).

## Intro
As a little side project, I decided to dabble in game development. For a brief moment I considered using the `pygame` framework. However at the time, little serious developments picked up the platform (I believe this has changed since). And since `Unreal Engine` and `Unity` are closed source, I decided to pick up Godot.

## Concept
Although the project is completely for fun and a creative outlet, I do enjoy the idea of it being accessible to whomever might want to try it. This was the foremost reason I decided on optimizing the game for mobile and tablet.

I decided on a couple of elements that, when combined, I hope makes my game unique. These elements are:
- Top-down Zelda style RPG
- Local multiplayer support
