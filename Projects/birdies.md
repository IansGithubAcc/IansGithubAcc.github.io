## Description
In my free time I like going on hikes. Whenever I go to a new location I often encounter new birds which I do not recognize.

To get a better idea of the birds around me, I made a little dashboard. The dashboard displays the recent spots in the area. It also allows you to browse the world so you can find out what kind of birds live in the area you intent on visiting.

```{warning} WIP

## Todo
