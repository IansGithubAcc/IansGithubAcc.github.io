# Welcome!
Of all the places on the internet, you seemed to have made your way to either the Github user [site](https://iansgithubacc.github.io/) of `IansGithubAcc` or its [repo](https://github.com/IansGithubAcc/IansGithubAcc.github.io).

The aim of this project is to give a quick overview of the projects I'm work on in my free time. Additionally, in the future I may write some blog posts, if I stumble upon anything interesting to share.

```{hint}
This site is my latest project at time of writing and it's still a work in progress. 
Much content is still missing for now. 
```
